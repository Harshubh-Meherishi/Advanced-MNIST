# Advanced-MNIST

Hey guys!
So I made this file as a fun exercise for an application to Inkers. 
The challenge was to make a Deep Learning CNN to train on the MNIST dataset for < 8000 parameters and achieve an accuracy of > 99.5%

Well, the way I went about it was to train a model with 7808 parameters using a CNN with Conv2d layers, batch normalisation, and ReLU. I achieved an accuracy of 99.52 for training and 99.42 for testing.

I ran the model for 25 epochs (Due to hardware limitations. My current device is configured with a Intel i3 chip and Intel UHD graphics, which do next to nothing.)

Check out the python notebook for more!
